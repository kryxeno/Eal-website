						<h3>Where it started</h3>
						<p>It all started with a group of people who had nothing to do during the quarantine. To keep things fun, they started a weekly competition to see who would take the throne. This has since flourished into a full competition, with a production team behind it.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Season 1</h3>
						<p>The league in season 1 existed out of 6 teams, all created through friends. Teams included: Team Turbo (now called 99 Woodcutting), Tax Evasion Gaming, One Mic Gang, Gentlemen, AHQ Flash Assasins and De Zaanse Prutsers. Team Turbo (99W) managed to win the season 1 championship.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Season 2</h3>
						<p>The competition started to become a lot more serious in season 2. There were a few additions in season 2: Get Colonized, Acceleration, Time To Throw, Last Place Legionaires and Free Agent Community. Get Colonized convincingly won EAL season 2.</p>

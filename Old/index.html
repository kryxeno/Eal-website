				<h2>BB King's <em>'Lucille'</em></h2>
				<p>This legend is one of the biggest names in blues. 
					BB King (formally known as Riley B. King) is considered as the single most important electric guitarist of the last half of the 20th century by AllMusic, the online music database.
				</p>
				<p>He often regarded his guitar as a second voice. 
					The moment he stopped singing orally, he started to sing by playing lucille.
				</p>	
				<blockquote><em>"I wanted to connect my guitar to human emotions."</em></blockquote>
				<p>'Lucille' isn't actually one guitar. King gave all of his guitars the same name, a name which he got in a very odd way.
				</p>
				<p>He found himself running into a burning building to save his (then unnamed) guitar.
					Afterwards, he found out two men started the fire whilst fighting over a girl named Lucille.

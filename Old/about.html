				<h2>Origin of Guitar Bridge</h2>
				<p>
					Guitar Bridge originated from a small town near Moscow, Canada. 
					This is where a small startup, aiming to enlighten people about the wonders of the guitar, started working on a website.
				</p>
				<p>
					Interestingly nobody in our team actually plays guitar, but that hasn't stopped us from spreading this magical instrument to the masses.
					We currently are in the process of learning it, as a big collaborative experiment, but it is a lot harder than it seems.
					Your hands will cramp and fingers will hurt for days at a time. 
				</p>	
				<p>
					The goal of Guitar Bridge is to bridge the gap between the regular world and the guitar world. 
					Teach people the different types of guitars, the culture, the techniques, etc...

                <p>Despite having to forfeit both of their games, Exile Gaming manages to take the 6th spot in playoffs!</p>
                <p>They have had a rocky season. Having had to forfeit 4 games this season, the likely hood of them getting into playoffs was quite low.
					Dirty Dancers needed to win one match in the last week, but they weren't able to get one and they barely missed out.
